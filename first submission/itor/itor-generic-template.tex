%Abstract
\begin{abstract}
In this paper, a model that combines the movement of a multi-visit drone with a limited endurance and a base vehicle that can move freely in the continuous space is considered. The mothership is used to charge the battery of the drone whereas the drone performs the task of visiting multiple targets of distinct shapes: points and polygonal chains. For polygonal chains, it is required to traverse a given percentage of its lengths that represent surveillance/inspection activities. The goal of the problem is to minimize the overall weighted distance traveled by both vehicles. A mixed integer second order cone program is developed and strengthened by using valid inequalities and giving good bounds to the Big-M constants that appear in the model. A refined matheuristic that provides reasonable solutions in short computing time is also established. The quality of the solutions provided by both approaches is compared and analyzed on an extensive battery of instances with different number and shapes of the targets that shows the usefulness of our approach its applicability in different situations.
