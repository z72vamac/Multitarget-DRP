%Abstract
\begin{abstract}
In this paper, a model that combines the movement of a multi-visit drone with a limited endurance and a base vehicle that can move freely in the continuous space is considered. The mothership is used to charge the battery of the drone whereas the drone performs the task of visiting multiple targets of distinct shapes: points and polygonal chains. For polygonal chains, it is required to traverse a given percentage of its lengths that represent surveillance/inspection activities. The goal of the problem is to minimize the overall weighted distance traveled by both vehicles. A mixed integer second order cone program is developed and strengthened by using valid inequalities and giving good bounds to the Big-M constants that appear in the model. A refined matheuristic that provides reasonable solutions in short computing time is also established. The quality of the solutions provided by both approaches is compared and analyzed on an extensive battery of instances with different number and shapes of the targets that shows the usefulness of our approach its applicability in different situations.

\section{Introduction}
% Heading 1
More and more frequently we hear about new technologies, as robots, self-driving vehicles and drones, and their use to replace humans in some activities, especially the most repetitive or dangerous ones, \cite{art:Chui2016}, or to create infrastructures and service networks alternative to traditional ones (see for example \cite{art:Chiaraviglio2019a} and \cite{art:Amorosi2019}). In this context, many management and coordination problems arise, which can also be addressed and solved by means of optimization models. The variety of problems and applications in this area has already led to a wide scientific production and to the development of extensions of existing combinatorial optimization models (see for example \cite{art:Pugliese2017}) or to the formalization of new classes of problems, also by resorting to non-linear programming, as in \cite{art:Amorosi2021} and \cite{art:Amorosi2021b}. 
In \cite{art:Cavani2021} and \cite{art:Roberti2021, art:Coindreau2021} the authors study exact methods for the Traveling Salesman Problem with one or multiple drones. An interesting literature review on drone routing problems is presented in \cite{art:Macrina2020}.
In particular, the use of drone technology in various sectors is a well-studied topic that continues to receive growing interest (see, e.g. \cite{art:Coindreau2021,art:Amico2021, art:WANG, art:VIDAL, art:MBIA}). Indeed, in a context where the urgency of sustainable solutions with low environmental impact is growing, this technology represents a valid alternative to the use of traditional means of transport. Furthermore, drones can also reach areas that are difficult to be reached by people and in a faster and safer way. Examples of this can be found both in the parcel delivery and in many inspection and monitoring activities also in post-disaster contexts (see \cite{art:Otto2018, art:Chung2020, art:Rojas2020} for extensive surveys).
In this work, we refer to these latter activities, resorting to the use of one drone supported by a mothership vehicle working as a mobile recharging station to manage its limited endurance. Such a system requires coordination and synchronization of the vehicles involved. In \cite{art:Amorosi2021} the authors studied the Mothership Drone Routing Problem with Graphs (AMDRPG) where one drone is supported by a mothership and they formulated the coordination problem in order to visit a set of target graphs by minimizing the total distance traveled by both vehicles. In \cite{art:Amorosi2021b} an extension of this problem with multiple drones, called the Mothership and Multiple Drones Routing Problem with Graphs (MMDRPG) has been investigated. In this paper we face the case in which one drone, supported by a mothership vehicle, must visit a set of targets but, differently with respect to the previously mentioned works, in each mission, the drone can visit more than one target or a portion of it.
We assume that the mothership can move freely in the continuous space and we consider two possible shapes of the target to be visited: (i) the targets are points or (ii) the targets are polygonal chains. This is an important contribution of this work as compared with recent papers in the literature where launching and retrieving points are forced to be nodes of a given network and targets are always points \citep{art:Cavani2021,art:Coindreau2021, art:Amico2021}.
We mathematically formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model for which we also derive valid inequalities to reinforce it.
Moreover, in order to deal with larger size instances, we design alternative matheuristic procedures. Extensive computational experiments are performed reporting the usefulness of our exact and heuristic methods to solve the problem.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{section:desc} describes the problem details and the proposed mathematical programming formulation. Section \ref{bounds} discusses a strengthening of the formulation also by resorting to valid inequalities. Section \ref{Math} presents (alternative) matheuristic procedures in order to deal with larger size instances of the problem. Section \ref{results} reports the experimental results obtained by testing the model on different instances of points and polygonal chains and the comparison with the ones provided by the matheuristic algorithms in order to evaluate their usefulness. Finally Section \ref{conclusions} concludes the paper.





In recent years the grow of the potential business opportunities related to the use of drone technology has motivated the appearance of an interesting body of methodological literature on optimizing of the use of such technology. 
We can find examples of that in many different sectors, like telecommunication where drones can be adopted in place of traditional infrastructures to provide connectivity (see for example \cite{art:Amorosi2018,art:Chiaraviglio2018,Jimenez2018,art:Amorosi2019,art:Chiaraviglio2019a}), or to temporary deal with the damages caused by a disaster \citep{art:Chiaraviglio2019}, deliveries (see for example \cite{art:Mathew2015, art:Ferrandez2016, art:Poikonen2020, art:Amorosi2020}), also in emergency contexts (\cite{art:Wen2016}), inspection \citep{art:Trotta2018} and others.
The reader is referred to the recent surveys \cite{art:Otto2018,  art:Chung2020, art:Rojas2020} for further details.\\
\noindent
Among the different aspects that can be considered we want to focus, for its relationship to the development in this paper, to the design, coordination and optimization of the combined routes of drones with a base vehicle. After the initial paper by Murray and Chu (2015) where a combined model of truck and drone is considered, Ulmer and Thomas (2018) also consider another model where trucks and drones are dispatched as order are placed and analyze the effect of different policies for either the truck or the drone. Other papers, as for instance, Campbell et al. (2017), Carlsson and Song (2017) and Dayarian et al. (2018), have also considered hybrid truck-and-drone models in order to mitigate the limited delivery range of drones. Poikonen and Golden (2019) advance on the coordination problem considering the \textit{Mothership and drone routing problem} where these two vehicles are used to design a route that visit a number of points allowing the truck to launch and recover the drone in a continuous space. More recently,  Poikonen and Golden (2020) considers the \textit{$k$-Multi-Visit drone routing problem} where a truck that acts as a mobile depot only allowed to stop in a predefined set of points, launches drones that can deliver more than one package to their designated destination points.
\noindent
Many of these papers make the assumptions that the set of allowable locations to launch/retrieve a drone are fixed and known a priori, the operations performed by the drone consist of delivering to a single point and the coordination is between a truck and a single drone. These assumptions may be appropriate in some frameworks but in other cases it may be better to relax them.\\
\noindent
{
In particular, only few papers in literature focus on drones operations consisting in traversing graphs rather than visiting single points.
\cite{art:Campbell2018} introduced the \textit{Drone Rural Postman Problem} (DRPP). The authors presented a solution algorithm based on the approximation of curves in the plane by polygonal chains and that iteratively increases the number of points in the polygonal chain where the UAV can enter or leave. Thus, they solved the problem as a discrete optimization problem trying to better define the line by increasing the number of points. The authors considered also the case in which the drone has limited capacity and thus it cannot serve all the lines. To deal with this latter case, they assumed to have a fleet of drones and the problem consisted in finding a set of routes, each of limited length.\\
In \cite{art:CAMPBELL202160}  this problem has been defined as the \textit{Length Constrained K-drones Rural Postman Problem}, a continuous optimization problem where a fleet of homogeneous drones have to jointly service (traverse) a set of (curved or straight) lines of a network. The authors designed and implemented a branch-and-cut algorithm for its solution and a matheuristic algorithm capable of providing good solutions for large scale instances of the problem.\\
As regards arc routing problems involving hybrid systems consisting in one vehicle and one or multiple drones, the number of contributions in literature is further restricted.\\
In \cite{art:Tokekar2016} the authors studied the path planning problem of a system composed of a ground robot and one drone in precision agriculture and solved it by applying orienteering algorithms. \cite{art:Garone2010} studied the problem of paths planning for systems consisting in a carrier vehicle and a carried one to visit a set of target points and assuming that the carrier vehicle moves in the continuous space.\\
To the best of our knowledge, only the paper \cite{art:Amorosi2021}, deals with the coordination of a mothership with one drone to visit targets represented by graphs. The authors made different assumptions on the route followed by the mothership: it can move on a continuous framework (the Euclidean plane), ii) on a connected piecewise linear polygonal chain or iii) on a general graph. In all cases, the authors developed exact formulations resorting to mixed integer second order cone programs and proposed a matheuristic algorithm capable to obtain high quality solutions in short computing time.
\\
In this paper we deal with an extension of the problem studied in \cite{art:Amorosi2021} for which we propose a novel truck-and-multi-drones coordination model.} We consider a {system} where a base vehicle (mothership) can stop anywhere in a continuous space and has to support the launch/retrieve of a number of drones that must visit graphs. The contribution on the existing literature is to extend the coordination beyond a single drone to the more cumbersome case of several drones and the operations to traversing graphs rather than visiting single points. {In particular, we focus on two variants of this problem: (i) the synchronous version in which every drone is launched and retrieved in the same stage; (ii) the asynchronous version where we assume that the mothership can retrieve one drone in a different stage from the one in which it has been launched. For both variants we present a mathematical programming formulation, valid inequalities to reinforce it and a matheuristic to deal with large instances.}\\
\noindent
The work is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed description of the problem under consideration and provides  mixed integer non linear programming formulations for the two variants of the problem. Section 3  provides some valid inequalities that strengthen the formulations and also derives upper and lower bounds on the big-M constants introduced in the proposed formulations. Section 4 presents details of the matheuristic algorithms designed to handle large instances. In Section 5 we report the results obtained testing the formulation and the matheuristic algorithms on different classes of planar graphs in order to assess its effectiveness. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

\section{Problem description and valid formulation}\label{section:desc}
% Datos iniciales del problema
\subsection{Problem description}\label{subsection:desc}
In the Multitarget Mothership and Drone Routing Problem (\AMD), there exists one drone that has to be coordinated with one mothership (that plays the role of base vehicle) to complete a number of operations consisting on visiting some targets. All these targets must be visited by the drone before finishing the complete tour. Both vehicles start at a known location, denoted $orig$, then they depart to perform all the operations and, once all the targets are visited, they must return together to a final location, called $dest$. We refer to an operation as the sequence of launching a drone from the mothership, visiting one or more targets and returning back to the mothership. The shape of the targets that are considered in this paper are points and polygonal chains. A similar analysis allows to extend the models from points to convex sets as well as from polygonal chains to general graphs (see \cite{art:Amorosi2021} and \cite{art:Amorosi2021b}). Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity and to improve the readability of this paper, we restrict ourselves to the above mentioned cases that already capture the essence of the problem. The operation of visiting a point consists on getting to it and coming back, whereas for polygonal chains the drone has to traverse a given percentage of their lengths for considering a successful visit. We also assume that the mothership and the drone travel at constant velocities $v_M$ and $v_D$, respectively, although it can be extended to more general cases where these velocities can be modelled as a time-dependent function. Moreover, the drone has a limited time $N$ (endurance) to complete each operation and return back to the base vehicle to recharge batteries. We assume that the drone and the base vehicle movements follow straight lines on a continuous space. This implies that Euclidean distance is used to measure displacements.
%Finally, the mothership is allowed to move freely in a continuous space: $\mathbb R^2$ or $\mathbb R^3$.


The set of targets $\mathcal{T}$ to be visited permit to model real situations like goods delivery or roads or wire inspection. Figure \ref{fig:Fig1} shows an example of the problem framework, where the black squares represent the origin and the destination of the mothership tour. 

% In this case, for the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that there exist no obstacles to prevent drone travelling in straight line. Nevertheless, that extension is interesting to be further considered although is beyond the scope of this paper.\\

\noindent

% 

%: once the drone assigned to the target enters the graph, it has to complete the entire operation of traversing this target before to be able to leave the graph to return to the base.

Moreover, at each operation the drone must be launched from the base vehicle (the launching points have to be determined) and it must be retrieved when its battery needs to be recharged (the retrieving points also have to be determined). Nonetheless, this does not imply that the tandem must reach at a rendezvous location at the same time: the base vehicle may wait for the drone at the rendezvous location. Furthermore, it is supposed that the cost produced by the drone's trip is lower as compared to the one incurred by the base vehicle. Therefore, the goal is to minimize the weighted total distance traveled by the mothership and the drone. Some works assume that this cost is negligible in comparison with the mothership (\cite{art:Amorosi2021}). The reader may note that the extension not including the distances traveled by the drone in the objective function is straightforward by setting the corresponding weight to zero.
\noindent

The goal of the \AMD \ is to find the launching and rendezvous points of the drone satisfying the visit requirements for the targets in $\mathcal T$ and minimizing the weighted length of the paths traveled by the mothership and the drone. \\

\noindent

% The mothership and the drone begin at a starting location, denoted $orig$ and a set $\mathcal G$ of target locations modeled by graphs, that must be visited by the drone, are located in the plane. These assumptions permit to model several real situations like roads or wired networks inspection.
% %The natural application for this situation comes from road or wired network inspection. 
% For each stage $t \in \{1, \ldots, |\mathcal G|\}$, we require that the drone is launched from the current mothership location, that at stage $t$ is a decision variable denoted by $x_L^t$, flies to one of the graphs $g$ that has to be visited , traverses the required portion of $g$ and then returns to the current position of the mothership, that most likely is different from the launching point $x_L^t$, and  that is another decision variable denoted by $x_R^t$. Once all targets graphs have been visited, the mothership and drone return to a final location (depot), denoted by $dest$.\\
% \noindent
% Let $g = (V_g, E_g)$ be a graph in $\mathcal G$ whose total length is denoted by $\mathcal L(g)$ and $e_g$ that denotes the edge $e$ of this graph $g$. This edge is parametrized by its endpoints $B^{e_g}, C^{e_g}$ and its length $\|\overline{B^{e_g}C^{e_g}}\|$ is denoted by $\mathcal L(e_g)$. For each line segment, we assign a binary variable $\mu^{e_g}$ that indicates whether or not the drone visits the segment $e_g$ and define entry and exit points $(R^{e_g}, \rho^{e_g})$ and $(L^{e_g}, \lambda^{e_g})$, respectively, that determine the portion of the edge visited by the drone. \\
% \noindent
% We have considered two modes of visit to the targets graphs $g\in \mathcal{G}$:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Visiting a percentage $\alpha^{e_g}$ of each edge $e_g$ which can be modeled by using the following constraints:
%     \begin{equation}\label{eq:alphaE}\tag{$\alpha$-E}
%     |\lambda^{e_g} - \rho^{e_g}|\mu^{e_g}\geq \alpha^{e_g}, \quad \forall e_g\in E_g.
%     \end{equation}
%     \item Visiting a percentage $\alpha_g$ of the total length of the graph:
%     \begin{equation}\label{eq:alphaG}\tag{$\alpha$-G}
%     \sum_{e_g\in E_g} \mu^{e_g}|\lambda^{e_g} - \rho^{e_g}|\mathcal L(e_g) \geq \alpha^g\mathcal L(g),
%     \end{equation}
%     where $\mathcal L(g)$ denotes the total length of the graph.
% \end{itemize}

% \bigskip
% \noindent
% In both cases, we need to introduce a binary variable $\text{entry}^{e_g}$ that determines the traveling direction on the edge $e_g$ as well as the definition of the parameter values $\nu_\text{min}^{e_g}$ and $\nu_\text{max}^{e_g}$ of the access and exit points to that segment. Then, for each edge $e_g$, the absolute value constraint \eqref{eq:alphaE} can be represented by:

% \begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha-E}\tag{$\alpha$-E}
%  \mu^{e_g}|\rho^{e_g}-\lambda^{e_g}|\geq \alpha^{e_g} \Longleftrightarrow
%  \left\{
%  \begin{array}{ccl}
%   \rho^{e_g} - \lambda^{e_g}                       & =    & \nu_\text{max}^{e_g} - \nu_\text{min}^{e_g}                                     \\
%   \nu_\text{max}^{e_g}                         & \leq & 1-{\text{entry}^{e_g}}                                    \\
%   \nu_\text{min}^{e_g}                      & \leq & {  \text{entry}^{e_g}},                                        \\
%   \mu^{e_g}(\nu_\text{max}^{e_g} + \nu_\text{min}^{e_g} ) & \geq & \alpha^{e_g}
%   \\
%  \end{array}
%  \right.
% \end{equation}

% \noindent
% The linearization of \eqref{eq:alphaG} is similar to \eqref{eq:alphaE} by changing the last inequality in \eqref{eq:alpha-E} for

% \begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha-G}\tag{$\alpha$-G}
% \sum_{e_g\in E_g} \mu^{e_g}(\nu_\text{max}^{e_g} + \nu_\text{min}^{e_g})\mathcal L(e_g)\geq \alpha_g\mathcal L(g).
% \end{equation}

% \noindent
% In our model wlog, we assume  that the mothership and drone do not need to arrive at a rendezvous location at the same time: the
% faster arriving vehicle may wait for the other at the rendezvous location. In addition, we also assume that vehicles move at constant speeds, although this hypothesis could be relaxed. . The mothership and the drone must travel together from $orig$ to the first launching point. Similarly, after the drone visits the last target location, the mothership and the drone must meet at the final rendezvous location before traveling together back to $dest$. The first launching location and final rendezvous location are allowed to be $orig$ and $dest$, respectively, but it is not mandatory. For the ease of presentation, in this paper we will assume that $orig$ and $dest$ are the same location. However, all results extend easily to the case that $orig$ and $dest$ are different locations.\\
% \noindent
% The goal is to find a minimum time path that begins at $orig$, ends at $dest$, and where
% every $g \in \mathcal G$ is visited by the drone.\\
% \noindent
% Depending on the assumptions made on the movements of the mothership vehicle this problem gives rise to two different versions: a) the mothership vehicle can move freely on the continuous space (all terrain ground vehicle, boat on the water or aircraft vehicle); and b) the mothership vehicle must move on a road network (that is, it is a normal truck or van). In the former case, that we will call All terrain Mothership-Drone Routing Problem with Graphs (\AMD), each launch and rendezvous location may be chosen from a continuous space (the Euclidean 2-or-3 dimension space). In the latter case, that we will call Network Mothership-Drone Routing Problem with Graphs (\NMD) from now on, each launch and rendezvouz location must be chosen on a given graph embedded in the considered space. For the sake of presentation and length  of the paper, we will focus in this paper, mainly, on the first model \AMD. The second model, namely \NMD, is addressed using similar techniques but providing slightly less details.

\subsection{Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming Formulations}\label{Form}
% \JP{In this section we present a MINLP formulation for the (\AMD). Let us denote by $\mathcal T$ the set of stages/tasks that the mothership and the fleet of drones have to carry out. These stages are visits to the different graphs in $\mathcal G$ with the required constraints. A stage $t\in\mathcal O$ is referred to as the operation in which the mothership launches some drones from a taking-off location, denoted by $x_L^o$ and later it takes them back on a rendezvous location $x_R^o$. Here, it is important to realize that both locations $x^L_t$ and $x^R_t$ must be determined in the continuous space where the mothership is assumed to move. Note that $|\mathcal T|\leq|\mathcal G|$, since it is assumed that, for each stage, at least one drone must be launched. Clearly, the distance $d_{LR}^o$ traveled by the base vehicle for the stage $t$, i.e., to go from $x_L^o$ to $x_R^o$ is
% $$d_{LR}^o=\|x_L^o - x_R^o\|,$$
% where $\|\cdot\|_2$ denoted the Euclidean distance,  although this assumption can be extended to any $l_p$ norm, $1\leq p\leq \infty$.} 
The purpose of this section is to present a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming formulation for the \AMD \ that can be applied to solve instances of this problem.

In Subsection \ref{subsection:desc}, we mention that the mothership can move without any restriction in a continuous space that for simplicity is supposed to be $\mathbb R^2$. Although it is possible to measure distances with any $l_p$-norm, $1\leq p\leq \infty$ (see \cite{Blanco2017}), for the sake of presentation, in this work the distances are measured by the Euclidean norm ($p= 2$).

First of all, we introduce the parameters or initial data that formally describe the problem and that are summarized in Table \ref{table:t1}.

To represent the movement of the drone within a polygonal $p\in\mathcal P$, we proceed to introduce some notation related to $p$.
Let $p = (V_p, S_p)$ be a polygonal chain in $\mathcal P$ whose total length is denoted by $\mathcal L(p)$. Here, $V_p$ denotes the set of vertices and $S_p$ denotes the set of segments connecting pairs of consecutive vertices whose cardinality is $|S_p|$. Let $s_p=\overline{v_p(v+1)_p}$ be the segment $s$ of the polygonal $p \in \mathcal P$ and let $\mathcal  L(s_p)$ be its length. Since we need to refer to interior points of the segment $s_p$, these continuum of points is parameterized by the two endpoints $A^{v_p}= (A^{v_p}(x_1), A^{v_p}(x_2))$ and $A^{(v+1)_p}= (A^{(v+1)_p}(x_1), A^{(v+1)_p}(x_2))$ of the segment: $x\in[A^{v_p}, A^{(v+1)_p}]$ if and only if $\exists \:\: \gamma\in[0, 1]$ such that $x=\gamma A^{v_p} + (1-\gamma)A^{(v+1)_p}$. Hence, the length of the segment $s_p$ is $\mathcal L(s_p) =\|A^{v_p} -  A^{(v+1)_p}\|$.

Next, we need to determine the placement of the entry point, $R^p$, on the polygonal chain $p$ introducing the following inequalities for each $p\in\mathcal P$:

\begin{equation}\label{P-C}\tag{$\mathcal P$-C}
\small
 R^p\in p \Longleftrightarrow
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{cclr}
 \gamma_R^{1_p}                     & \leq & \mu_R^{1_p},                                  & \\
 \gamma_R^{s_p}                     & \leq & \mu_R^{s_p-1} + \mu_R^{s_p}, & s_p\in S_p \setminus\{1\},\\
 \gamma_R^{|V_p|_p}             & \leq & \mu_R^{|S_p|_p}, \\
 \displaystyle\sum_{s_p\in S_p} \mu_R^{s_p}      &   =  & 1, & \\
 \displaystyle\sum_{v_p\in V_p} \gamma_R^{v_p}   &   =  & 1, & \\
  R^p                               & = & \displaystyle\sum_{v_p\in V_p}\gamma_R^{v_p}A^{v_p}. & \\
 \end{array}
 \right.
\end{equation}

The first, second and third inequalities link $\mu_R^{s_p}$ and $\gamma_R^{s_p}$ variables: they state that the variable $\gamma_R^{s_p}$ that gives the representation of a point $R^p$ on the line segment $s_p$ is active (non-null) only if this line segment is chosen to enter in polygonal $p$, i.e., $\mu_R^{s_p}=1$. The fourth equation sets that only one line segment is chosen for entering each polygonal chain. Finally, the fifth and sixth equations set the representation of $R^p$ as a convex combination of the extreme points of the selected line segment.
In the same way, we can model the location of the exit point, $L^p$, by using the variables $L^p$, $\mu_L^{s_p}$ and $\gamma_L^{s_p}$ explained in Table \ref{table:t2} and Table \ref{table:t3}, respectively.

% We shall refer to $e_g$  as a generic edge $e$ of this graph $g$. The  edge $e_g$ is determined by its endpoints $B^{e_g}, C^{e_g}$ and its length $\|\overline{B^{e_g}C^{e_g}}\|$ is denoted by $\mathcal L(e_g)$. For each edge $e_g$, we assign a binary variable $\mu^{e_g}$ that indicates whether or not the drone visits $e_g$. In addition, for each edge $e_g$ we define an entry $(R^{e_g}, \rho^{e_g})$ and an exit point $(L^{e_g}, \lambda^{e_g})$, being $\rho^{e_g}$ and $\lambda^{e_g}$ the values in the parametrization of the edge $e_g$ where the drone enters and leaves the edge. \\

% \CV{In both cases the corresponding constraints are nonlinear. In order to linearize them, we need to introduce a binary variable} $\text{entry}^{e_g}$ that determines the traveling direction on the edge $e_g$ as well as the definition of the parameter values $\nu_\text{min}^{e_g}$ and $\nu_\text{max}^{e_g}$ of the access and exit points to that segment. Then, for each edge $e_g$, the absolute value constraint \eqref{eq:alphaE} can be represented by:

% \begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha-E}\tag{$\alpha$-E}
%  \mu^{e_g}|\rho^{e_g}-\lambda^{e_g}|\geq \alpha^{e_g} \Longleftrightarrow
%  \left\{
%  \begin{array}{ccl}
%   \rho^{e_g} - \lambda^{e_g}                       & =    & \nu_\text{max}^{e_g} - \nu_\text{min}^{e_g}                                     \\
%   \nu_\text{max}^{e_g}                         & \leq & 1-{\text{entry}^{e_g}}                                    \\
%   \nu_\text{min}^{e_g}                      & \leq & {  \text{entry}^{e_g}},                                        \\
%   \mu^{e_g}(\nu_\text{max}^{e_g} + \nu_\text{min}^{e_g} ) & \geq & \alpha^{e_g}
%   \\
%  \end{array}
%  \right.
% \end{equation}

% \noindent
% The linearization of \eqref{eq:alphaG} is similar to \eqref{eq:alphaE} by changing the last inequality in \eqref{eq:alpha-E} for

% \begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha-G}\tag{$\alpha$-G}
% \sum_{e_g\in E_g} \mu^{e_g}(\nu_\text{max}^{e_g} + \nu_\text{min}^{e_g})\mathcal L(e_g)\geq \alpha_g\mathcal L(g).
% \end{equation}

In our approach to model the \AMD \ we use operations identified with the order in which the different elements in the problem are visited. Let us denote by $\mathcal O$ the set of operations that the mothership and the drone have to carry out. An operation $o\in\mathcal O$ is referred to as the one in which the mothership launches a drone from a taking-off location, denoted by $x_L^o$ and later it takes it back on a rendezvous location $x_R^o$. Each operation consists on the drone visit to one or more targets in $\mathcal T$ with the required constraints. At this point, it is relevant to note that the pair of locations $x_L^o$ and $x_R^o$ must be selected in the plane where the mothership is presumed to move. Observe that $|\mathcal O|\leq|\mathcal T|$ because of the assumption that at least one target is visited for each operation.

% According to the notation introduced above, we write this generic path in the following form:

% $$
% x_L^o\rightarrow R^{p}\rightarrow L^{e_g}\rightarrow\ldots\rightarrow R^{e^\prime_g}\rightarrow L^{e^\prime_g}\rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow R^{e''_g} \rightarrow x_R^o\rightarrow x_L^{t+1}.
% $$

Figure \ref{fig:Fig1} shows an example of problem instance with 4 polygonal targets. The point $orig$ from where the mothership together with the drone must start their tour, is located in the origin, while the destination point $dest$ is the point (100,100).
    
     
\input{figures/figure1}
% \label{fig:Fig1}

To include the definition of the paths followed by the drone in our mathematical programming formulation we need to make decisions to choose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The optimal assignment of the targets to each operation $o$.
    \item The optimal order to visit the targets for its corresponding operation $o$.
\end{itemize}

% Binary variables
% Thus, to this end one can define the following binary variables:

We can model the route followed by the drone using the binary variables $u^{to}$, $y^{tt'o}$, $\delta^{to}$ and $v^{to}$ defined in Table \ref{table:t2}.


% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $u^{{e_g}td} = 1$ if the visit of graph $g$ is done at stage $t$ by the drone $d$ and it starts from edge $e_g$.
%   \item $v^{{e_g}td}= 1$ if the visit of graph $g$ that is done by drone $d$ at stage $t$ finishes in the edge $e_g$.
%   \item $z^{e_ge'_g}= 1$ if the drone moves from edge $e_g$ to $e'_g$ while visiting the graph $g$.
% \end{itemize}

% By using these binary variables, we can model the route that follows the drone:
\begin{align}
    \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} u^{to} & \leq 1, &\forall o\in \mathcal O, \label{st:DEnt}\\%\tag{DEn}\\
    \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} v^{to} & \leq 1, &\forall o\in \mathcal O, \label{st:DExt}\\%\tag{DEx}\\
    \sum_{o\in \mathcal O} \delta^{to} & = 1, &\forall t\in \mathcal T, \label{st:DIn} \\
    \delta^{to} - u^{to} & = \sum_{t'\neq t} y^{t'to}, &\forall t\in \mathcal T,\:\forall o\in \mathcal O, \label{st:Dinu}\\
    \delta^{to} - v^{to} & = \sum_{t'\neq t} y^{tt'o}, &\forall t\in \mathcal T,\:\forall o\in \mathcal O, \label{st:Dinv}\\
    \sum_{t, t'\in S}y^{tt'o} & \leq |S|-1, &\forall S\subsetneq\mathcal T,\:\forall o\in\mathcal O.
    \label{st:SEC}
    % \sum_{e_g\in E_g} \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} \sum_{d\in\mathcal D} u^{to} & = 1, &\forall g\in\mathcal G \label{st:DEng}\\%\tag{D
    % \sum_{e_g\in E_g} \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} \sum_{d\in\mathcal D} v^{to} & = 1, &\forall g\in\mathcal G \label{st:DExg}\\%\tag{D
    % \sum_{e_g\in E_g} u^{to} & = \sum_{e_g\in E_g} v^{to}, &\forall g\in\mathcal G, \forall o\in \mathcal T, \forall d\in\mathcal D \label{st:Duv}\\%\tag{D
    % \sum_{e^\prime_g\in E_g} z_g^{e^\prime_ge_g} + \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} \sum_{d \in \mathcal D} u^{to} & = \mu^{e_g}, &\forall e_g\in E_g:g\in\mathcal G, \forall d\in\mathcal D \label{st:DInu}\\
    % \sum_{e^\prime_g\in E_g} z_g^{e_ge^\prime_g} + \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} \sum_{d \in \mathcal D} v^{to} & = \mu^{e_g}, &\forall e_g\in E_g:g\in\mathcal G \label{st:DInv}
\end{align}

Constraints \eqref{st:DEnt} and \eqref{st:DExt} state that for each operation the drone only can enter and exit, respectively, by one target.  Constraints \eqref{st:DIn} ensure that every target will be visited in some operation. Constraints \eqref{st:Dinu} assure that if target $t$ is visited by the drone for the operation $o$, one of two alternative conditions must take place: either $t$ is the first target for the operation $o$ or target $t$ is visited by the drone after visiting another target $t'$ for the operation $o$. Similarly, constraints \eqref{st:Dinv} state that if the target $t$ for the operation $o$ is visited by the drone, either $t$ is the last target of the operation, or the drone must move to another target $t'$ of the operation $o$ after visiting target $t$. Finally, inequalities \eqref{st:SEC} are the subtour elimination constraints applied to each operation. Note that, the complete family of SEC constraints can not be included to the model when we implement this formulation, because there is a exponential number of them and it can induce a memory problem on-the-shelf solvers. This problem can be solved by performing a row generation procedure that includes the constraints whenever they are needed by a separation oracle. To detect these SEC inequalities, as usual, we look for disconnected components in the current solution. Among them, we choose the shortest subtour found in the solution to be added as a lazy constraint to the model.\\

% Constraints \eqref{st:DInu} (resp. \eqref{st:DInv}) state that if the edge $e_g$ is visited, $\mu^{e_g}=1$, then either the drone enters coming from (leaves to) the mothership, $\sum_{t\in \mathcal T} \sum_{d \in \mathcal D} u^{to}=1$ ($\sum_{t\in \mathcal T} \sum_{d \in \mathcal D} v^{to}=1$), or it enters from (leaves to) another edge $e^\prime_g$, $\sum_{e^\prime_g\in E_g} z_g^{e^\prime_ge_g}=1$ ($\sum_{e^\prime_g\in E_g} z_g^{e_ge^\prime_g} =1$).

% A first attempt to model this problem uses stages identified with the order in which the different elements in the problem are visited. We identify each visit to one of the target graphs with a stage of the process. Then, by using the notation below, we define the stages set associated to graphs $T:=\{1,\ldots,|\mathcal G|\}$ and those associated to the launching and rendezvous points including $orig$ and $dest$ $T'=\{0,\ldots,|\mathcal G|+1\}$. For each stage $t\in T$, the drone follows the following path starting from the mothership, visiting the required edges of $g$ and returning to the mothership:

% $$
% x_L^o\rightarrow R^{e_g}\rightarrow L^{e_g}\rightarrow\ldots\rightarrow R^{e^\prime_g}\rightarrow L^{e^\prime_g}\rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow R^{e''_g} \rightarrow x_R^o\rightarrow x_L^{t+1}.
% $$

% This path calls in a natural way for the definition of binary variables that choose:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The optimal order to visit each graph $g\in\mathcal G$. In other words, defining the sequence of the stages.
%     \item The optimal order to visit the edges of each graph in its corresponding stage.
% \end{itemize}

% Thus, to this end one can define the following binary variables:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item $u^{e_gt} = 1$ if the drone enters by the segment $e_g$ at the stage $t$.
%     \item $z^{e_ge^\prime_g} = 1$ if the drone goes from the segment $e_g$ to the segment $e^\prime_g$.
%     \item $v^{e_gt} = 1$ if the drone exits the graph by the segment $e_g$ at the stage $t$.
% \end{itemize}

% By using these binary variables, we can model the route that follows the drone:
% \begin{align}
%     \sum_{g\in \mathcal G}\sum_{e_g\in E_g} u^{e_gt} & = 1, &\forall o\in T \label{st:DEnt}\\%\tag{DEn}\\

% \end{align}

% \noindent
% Equations \eqref{st:DEnt} and \eqref{st:DExt} state that in each stage the drone visits (enter and exit, respectively) only one graph. Constraints \eqref{st:DEng} and \eqref{st:DExg} assure that each graph is visited at some stage. Constraints \eqref{st:DInu} (resp. \eqref{st:DInv}) state that the number of exterior edges plus the number of interior edges that enter (resp. exit) to the edge $e_g$ is given by $\mu^{e_g}$.

% \subsubsection*{Elimination of subtours}
% In order to represent actual routes of the drones over the target graphs subtours cannot be allowed. Note that subtours would represent fake operations since they would allow free jumps of the drone between different routes at zero cost. To prevent the existence of subtours within each graph $g\in \mathcal G$ that the drone must visit, one can include, among others, either the compact formulation that uses the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin constraints (MTZ) or the subtour elimination  constraints (SEC).\\
% \noindent
% For the MTZ formulation, we define the continuous variables $s^{e_g}$, \CV{defined in Table \ref{table:t2}}, that state the order to visit the edge $e_g$ and set the following constraints for each $g\in\mathcal G$:

% \begin{align}
%     s^{e_g} - s^{e^\prime_g} + |E_g|z^{e_ge^\prime_g} & \leq |E_g| - 1  , &\quad\forall e_g \neq e_g'\in E_g \tag{MTZ$_1$} \label{MTZ1}\\
%     0 & \leq s^{e_g} \leq |E_g| - 1 &\quad\forall e_g\in E_g\tag{MTZ$_2$}\label{MTZ2}
% \end{align}

% \noindent
% Alternatively, we can also use the family of subtour elimination constraints:
% \begin{equation}\tag{SEC}\label{SEC}
%     \sum_{e_g, e^\prime_g \in S} z_g^{e_ge^\prime_g} \leq |S| - 1, \quad \forall S\subset E_g:g\in \mathcal G
% \end{equation}

% \noindent
% %(Copiado del XPPN)
% Since there is an exponential number of SEC constraints, when we implement this formulation we need to perform a row generation procedure including constraints whenever they are required by a separation oracle. To find SEC inequalities, as usual, we search for disconnected components in the current solution. Among them, we choose the shortest subtour found in the solution to be added as a lazy constraint to the model.\\

\noindent
To take into account the different distances among the decision variables of the model, we need to set the continuous variables $d_L^{to}$, $d_{\text{out}}^{tt'}$, $d_{\text{in}}^t$, $d_R^{to}$, $d_{RL}^o$ and $d_{LR}^o$, defined in Table \ref{table:t3}. This can be done by means of the following constraints:
 
 %define the following instrumental variables:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item $d_L^{to} = \|x_L^o - R^{e_g}\|$. Distance traveled by the drone $d$ from the launching point at the stage $t$ to the first visiting point in the segment $e_g$.
%     \item $d^{e_ge^\prime_g} = \|R^{e_g} - L^{e^\prime_g}\|$. Distance traveled by the drone $d$ from the launching point in $e_g$ to the next rendezvous point in the following edge $e^\prime_g$ of the graph $g$.
%     \item $d^{e_g} = \|R^{e_g} - L^{e_g}\|$. Distance traveled by the drone from the retrieving point  to the next launching point in $e_g$.
%     \item $d_R^{to} = \|L^{e_g} - x_R^o\|$. Distance traveled by the drone $d$ from the launching point in the last segment $e_g$ visited of the graph $g$ to the retrieving point on the mothership at the stage $t$.
%     \item $d_{LR}^o = \|x_L^o - x_R^o\|$. Distance traveled by the mothership from the launching point to the retrieving point at the stage $t$.
%     \item $d_{RL}^o = \|x_R^o - x_L^{t+1}\|$. Distance traveled by the mothership from the retrieving point at stage $t$ to the launching point at stage $t+1$.
% \end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
\|x_L^o- R^t\| & \leq  d_L^{to},  &\quad \forall t\in\mathcal T, \forall o\in \mathcal O,\tag{DIST$_{1}$} \label{eq:d1}\\
\|R^{t}- L^{t'}\| & \leq  d_{\text{out}}^{tt'}, &\quad \forall t, t'\in\mathcal T, \tag{DIST$_{2}$} \label{eq:d2}\\
\|L^{t}- x_R^o\| & \leq  d_R^{to}, &\quad \forall t\in\mathcal T,\forall o\in \mathcal O, \tag{DIST$_{3}$} \label{eq:d3}\\
\|x_L^o- x_R^o\| & \leq  d_{LR}^o, & \quad \forall o\in \mathcal O. \tag{DIST$_{4}$} \label{eq:d4}\\
\|x_R^o- x_L^{o+1}\| & \leq  d_{RL}^o, & \quad \forall o\in \mathcal O\setminus\{|\mathcal O|\}. \tag{DIST$_{5}$} \label{eq:d6}\\
\end{align*}

Note that $d_{\text{in}}^t$ is zero when the target is a point. However, to compute the distance inside the polygonal, we need to set the following expressions for each $p\in\mathcal P$:

% set the following constraints for each $p\in\mathcal P$:

% \begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha-p}\tag{$\alpha-\mathcal P$}

% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}\tag{$d_{\mathcal P}$}\label{eq:dP}
d_{\mathcal P}^{s_ps'_p} = \left\{\begin{matrix}
|\gamma_R^{s_p} - \gamma_L^{s'_p}|\mathcal L(s_p), & \text{if } s_p = s'_p,\\
(1 - \gamma_L^{s_p})\mathcal L(s_p) + \sum_{s'' = s_p+1}^{s'_p-1}\mathcal L(s'') + \gamma_{R}^{s'_p}\mathcal L(s'_p), & \text{if } s_p < s'_p, \\
\gamma_L^{s_p}\mathcal L(s_p) + \sum_{s'' = s'_p+1}^{s_p-1}\mathcal L(s'') + (1-\gamma_{R}^{s'_p})\mathcal L(s'_p), & \text{if } s_p > s'_p.
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{equation}
This expression needs to define a binary variable $z_{\mathcal P}$ that determines whether $d_{\mathcal P}$ is defined by the first, the second or the third expression in the formula:
\begin{equation*}
z_{\mathcal P}^{s_ps'_p} = \mu_R^{s_p}\mu_L^{s'_p}.
\end{equation*}
Finally, we can compute the total distance between the launching and the rendezvous points in each polygonal $p\in\mathcal P$:
\begin{equation}\tag{DIST$_{6}$} \label{eq:d6}
    d_{\text{in}}^p = \sum_{s_p,s'_p\in S_p} d_{\mathcal P}^{s_ps'_p}z_{\mathcal P}^{s_ps'_p}.    
\end{equation}
\noindent
In \cite{art:Amorosi2021,Puerto2021} it is discussed the idea of traversing a polygonal chain and the authors consider two different modes: 1) visiting a percentage of the total length of the graph and 2) traversing a given percentage of the length of each one of its segments. From an application point of view, the reader may understand these operations as reliability inspections so that testing a given percentage of the target suffices to certify a correct operation. Looking at the difficulty of these operation modes, the computational results reported in that work suggest that there is not a meaningful difference in terms of difficulty induced by the considered mode of visit. Hence, for the sake of simplicity, we only consider a simpler form of the first case where the drone, once it enters the polygonal chain, has to traverse the entire required percentage before leaving the target. In other words, no preemption is allowed. To include this requirement, we only need to impose that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha-p}\tag{$\alpha-\mathcal P$}
d_{\text{in}}^p \geq \alpha^p \mathcal{L}(p).
\end{equation}

There exists a special case of the above condition, when all the segments of the polygonal chain have the same length, that enables a simplified representation. We refer the interested reader to the Appendix \ref{appendix} for further details of these constraints.


The coordination between the drone and the mothership must ensure that the time spent by the drone to do the operation $o$ is less than or equal to the time that the mothership needs to move from the launching point to the retrieving point during this operation. To this end, we include the following coordination constraint for each operation $o\in \mathcal O$:

\begin{equation}\tag{DCW}\label{DCW}
\frac{1}{v_D}\left(\sum_{t\in \mathcal T} u^{to}d_L^{to} + \sum_{t, t'\in \mathcal T}y^{tt'o}d_{\text{out}}^{tt'} + \sum_{t\in\mathcal T} \delta^{to}d_{\text{in}}^{t} + \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} v^{to}d_R^{to}\right) \leq \frac{d_{LR}^o}{v_M}.
\end{equation}

\noindent
Eventually, we have to impose that the tour of the mothership, together with the drone, starts from the origin $orig$ and ends at the destination $dest$. This is ensured by including the following constraints:

\begin{align*}
x_L^0 & =  orig,  \tag{ORIG$_1$} \label{eq:O1} \\
x_R^0 & =  orig,  \tag{ORIG$_2$} \label{eq:O2} \\
x_L^{|\mathcal{O}|+1} & =  dest,  \tag{DEST$_1$} \label{eq:D1} \\
x_R^{|\mathcal{O}|+1} & =  dest.  \tag{DEST$_2$} \label{eq:D2} 
\end{align*}

Observe that, one of the addends of the objective function of this problem minimizes the right-hand-side of \eqref{DCW}. Thus, this constraint will become an equality and thus, it is able to model the time capacity (endurance) restriction for a particular operation $o\in \mathcal O$ by limiting the space traveled by the mothership for this operation:

\begin{equation}\tag{Capacity}\label{CAP}
    d_{LR}^o \leq N.
\end{equation}


% \end{itemize}


% A natural approach to model this problem is to consider stages which are identified with the targets that the drone has to visit. This way the problem needs to considers $|\mathcal{G}|$ stages that are indexed by $t=1,\ldots, |\mathcal{G}|$. To provide a valid formulation for the model under this approach, we introduce the following variables:
% \begin{itemize}

\noindent
The goal of the \AMD\xspace is to find a feasible solution that minimizes the total weighted distance traveled by the mothership and the drone. The following formulation, that includes all the constraints explained before, gives an exact model for this problem:
% \begin{mini*}|s|
%  {}{\beta_D\left(\sum_{t\in \mathcal T}\sum_{o\in \mathcal O} u^{to}d_L^{to} + \sum_{t\in \mathcal T}\sum_{o\in \mathcal O}\delta^{to}d_{\text{in}}^t + \sum_{t\neq t'\in\mathcal T}\sum_{o\in \mathcal O}y^{tt'o}d_{\text{out}}^{tt'} + \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} \sum_{o\in \mathcal O}v^{to}d_R^{to}\right) + \beta_M\left(\sum_{o\in\mathcal O}d_{LR}^o+\sum_{o\in \mathcal O\setminus\{|\mathcal O|\}} d_{RL}^o\right)}{}{} \label{Multi-MDRP} \tag{Multitarget-MDRP}

\begin{align*}\label{Multi-MDRP} \tag{Multitarget-MDRP}

	& \eqref{eq:d1}-\eqref{eq:d6},\\
	& \eqref{eq:O1}-\eqref{eq:D2}.
\end{align*}

\noindent
The objective function describes the weighted distances traveled by the drone and the mothership, respectively. Constraints \eqref{st:DEnt}-\eqref{st:SEC} model the path made by the drone; \eqref{P-C} and \eqref{eq:alpha-p} describe the location of the rendezvous and launching points and the requirement of visiting an $\alpha$ percentage for the polygonal chain $p\in\mathcal P$, respectively. Constraint \eqref{eq:dP} computes the distance between each pair of segments in the polygonal chain. Constraints (\ref{eq:d1})-(\ref{eq:d6}) set the variables $d_L^{to}$, $d_{\text{out}}^{tt'}$, $d_R^{to}$ , $d_{LR}^o$, $d_{RL}^o$ and $d_{\text{in}}^{t}$, defined in Table \ref{table:t3}, which set the Euclidean distances required in the model. \\

\input{figures/figure2}
\input{figures/figure3}
% Then, the next six constraints model Euclidean distances needed in the model. \\
% \noindent
% Observe that we are assuming constant velocities for the mothership $v_M$ and the drone $v_D$.\\
Note that, to handle the bilinear terms that appear in the objective function and in the \eqref{DCW} constraint, we make use of the McCormick's envelopes to linearize these terms by including variables $q\geq 0$  representing the products and introducing the following constraints:
\begin{align*}
    q & \leq  M z, \\
    q & \leq  d, \\
    q & \geq m z, \\
    q & \geq d - M(1 - z),
\end{align*}
where $m$ and $M$ are, respectively, the lower and upper bounds of the distance variable $d$. These bounds will be tightened for each bilinear term in Section \ref{bounds}.

Figure \ref{fig:Fig2} shows an example of solution obtained by means of the exact method solving the formulation. We run the model on the same example of Figure \ref{fig:Fig1} and we obtained the optimal solution consisting in the mothership tour, represented by the blue polygonal chain starting from the origin $orig$, ending at the destination $dest$, and with drone movements represented with the dotted red segments. The mothership launches the drone for its first operation from $x_L^1$. The drone flies to the retrieving point $R^1$ for visiting a portion (50\%) of the first target. It leaves the first target from point $L^1$ and meets the mothership at point $x_R^1$. This point is also the launching point from where the drone starts its second operation for visiting the second target. From that point it flies to point $R^2$ and traverses the portion of the second target from $R^2$ to $L^2$. Then, the drone flies to point $x_R^2$ where it meets again the mothership. From this point the drone starts its last operation for visiting the third and the fourth targets. Indeed, after visiting the third target from point $R^3$ to point $L^3$, it directly flies to point $R^4$ of the last target. It visits the required portion of this last target from point $R^4$ to $L^4$ and then meets the mothership at point $x_R^3$. The mothership and the drone complete their service at the destination $dest$.\\
Figure \ref{fig:Fig3} shows a zoom on the last two targets of the example of solution reported in Figure \ref{fig:Fig2}. We can visualize in detail the values of the different binary variables introduced in the formulation to define the order of visit of the targets, the launching and retrieving points and thus the mothership and drone tours. In particular, variable $u^{33}=1$ indicates that the third operation of the drone starts in the third target from point $R^3$. This point is located on the line segment 2 of the polygonal target 3, $\mu_R^{2_3}=1$, and it is also the retrieving point $x_R^2$ of the second operation. The visit on the third target ends at the launching point $L^3$ that is located on the line segment 4 of the polygonal target 3, $\mu_R^{4_3}=1$. Indeed, the visit of target 3 starts in segment 2 and ends in segment 4, $z_3^{24}=1$. From this point, always during the third operation, the drone directly flies to the last target, that is target 4, $y^{343}=1$. The visit of the target 4 starts from the point $R^4$, located on the line segment 2, $\mu_R^{2_4}=1$, and ends at the launching point $L^4$, located on the line segment 4, $\mu_R^{4_4}=1$. Eventually, the third and last operation of the drone finishes on target 4, $v^{43}=1$.

\section{Strengthening the formulation of \AMD}\label{bounds}

\subsection{Pre-processing} \label{sec:preprocessing}
In this subsection we explore the nature of the problem to fix a priori some variables and to increase the efficiency of the model. Particularly, the following proposition allows to fix $y^{tt'o}$ binary variables to zero.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:preprocessing}
Let $t, t'\in\mathcal T$ be two targets. Let $d_{\text{min}}(t, t')$ denote the minimum distance between them and $length(t)$, the length of the target $t$. If $t, t'$ verify that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ytto}
    \alpha^t\,length(t) + d_{\text{min}}(t, t')  + \alpha^{t'}\,length(t') > \frac{v_D}{v_M}\,N, 
\end{equation}
then the drone cannot visit in  a single operation $t$ and $t'$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let assume that the drone can go from $t$ to $t'$ in the operation $o$. Then it must satisfy \eqref{CAP} and \eqref{DCW} constraints:

$$
\sum_{t\in \mathcal T} u^{to}d_L^{to} + \sum_{t, t'\in \mathcal T}y^{tt'o}d_{\text{out}}^{tt'} + \sum_{t\in\mathcal T} \delta^{to}d_{\text{in}}^{t} + \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} v^{to}d_R^{to} \leq \frac{v_D}{v_M}\,N.
$$

Since $d_L^{to}, d_R^{to}\geq 0$, the left hand side of this inequality can be  bounded from below by the left hand side of \eqref{eq:ytto}:

$$
\alpha^t\,length(t) + d_{\text{min}}(t, t')  + \alpha^{t'}\,length(t') \leq \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} u^{to}d_L^{to} + \sum_{t, t'\in \mathcal T}y^{tt'o}d_{\text{out}}^{tt'} + \sum_{t\in\mathcal T} \delta^{to}d_{\text{in}}^{t} + \sum_{t\in \mathcal T} v^{to}d_R^{to},
$$

which is impossible because each side is lower (resp. upper) bounded by $\frac{v_D}{v_M}\,N$. 

% Note that the distance that the drone must travel to visit $t$ and $t'$ in the same operation can be lower bounded by the left side of the inequation \eqref{eq:ytto}.
\end{proof}

% Since there exists the \eqref{CAP} constraint and the drone endurance is limited, some $y^{tt'o}$ must be zero, i.e., the drone can not go from the target $t$ to the target $t'$ for the operation 



\subsection{Valid inequalities for the \AMD} 

In this subsection we introduce some valid inequalities for \AMD \ that strengthen the formulation presented in the Subsection \ref{Form}. In addition, the constraint that coordinates the movement of the drone and the mothership, namely \eqref{DCW}, and the objective function of the model hold products of binary and continuous variables. Each of these products generates big-M constants that must be tightened, when they are linearized. The present section provides some bounds for these constants.

For this problem, we are assuming that the drone  endurance suffices to visit more than one target in the same operation because, otherwise, the problem is similar to (AMDRPG) that has  been already considered in \cite{art:Amorosi2021}. Hence, provided that there exists an operation in which the drone visits two or more targets, the mothership does not need to perform $|\mathcal O|$ different operations. This idea can be used to compactify all the operations made by the drone on the first operations, avoiding void tasks in $\mathcal O$.
\noindent

Let $\beta^o$ be a binary variable that attains the value one if the entire set of targets is visited when the operation $o$ starts, and zero, otherwise. Observe that, if the drone has traversed all the targets before the operation $o$ then they are also traversed before to start the operation $o+1$. Therefore, $\beta$ variables must fulfill the following constraints:

\begin{equation}\tag{Monotonicity}\label{eq:Monotonicity}
\beta^{o} \leq \beta^{o+1}, \mbox{ for all } o=1,\ldots, |\mathcal{O}|-1.
\end{equation}
Let $k^o$ represent the number of targets that are visited at the operation $o$. $\delta$ variables can be used to compute this number because $\delta^{to}$ attains the value one when the target $t$ is visited in the operation $o$. Thus:

$$k^o=\sum_{t\in\mathcal T} \delta^{to}.$$

Thus, if $\beta^o$ is one, the full set $\mathcal T$ must have been visited before the operation $o$:

\begin{equation}\tag{VI-1}\label{eq:VI-1}
\sum_{o'=1}^{o-1} k^{o'} \geq |\mathcal T|\beta^o,
\end{equation}
where $|\mathcal T|$ stands for the cardinality of $\mathcal T$.

To reduce the space of feasible solutions, it is possible to assume, without loss of generality, that it is not allowed to have an operation $o$ without any visit if the drone still has to visit some targets. To enforce that, we can set the following constraints:

\begin{equation}\tag{VI-2}\label{eq:VI-2}
k^o \geq 1 - \beta^o.
\end{equation}

Following the idea given in the Proposition \ref{prop:preprocessing} of the previous subsection, we can set some valid inequalities that indicate that the drone cannot visit a subset $S\subset\mathcal{T}$ of targets because of the \eqref{CAP} constraint. Let $\mathcal S$ be the collection of subsets of $\mathcal T$ that do not verify \eqref{CAP}, then:

% $$\mathcal S = \{S\subset \mathcal T: S \text{ does not verify \eqref{CAP}}\}$$
\begin{equation}\tag{VI-3}\label{eq:VI-3}
\sum_{t\in S} \delta^{to} \leq |S| - 1, \qquad\forall S\in \mathcal S, \quad\forall o\in\mathcal O.
\end{equation}

We can construct $\mathcal S$ by fixing the $\delta$ variables and partially solving \eqref{Multi-MDRP} for each subset of $\mathcal T$, which is a very expensive computation. However, it is sufficient to find minimal subsets by monotonicity.

% In addition, it is also possible to reduce the symmetry. Since we are assuming that drones are indistinguishable, we can assume that given an arbitrary order on them, we always assign drones to operations in that given order. This assumption allows us to assign for an operation at the stage $t$ the first drone that is available, avoiding to consider the last ones, if they are not necessary. This consideration can be implemented with the following set of inequalities. For all $t\in\mathcal T$:
% \medskip

% % \noindent **** OJO :  Mas fuertes ************
% \begin{equation}\tag{VI-3}\label{eq:VI-3}
% \sum_{e_g\in \mathcal G} u^{e_gtd} \leq \sum_{e_g:g\in\mathcal G}u^{e_gtd-1}, \; \forall d=2,\ldots |\mathcal D|.      
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}\tag{VI-4}\label{eq:VI-4}
% \sum_{e_g\in \mathcal G} v^{e_gtd} \leq \sum_{e_g:g\in\mathcal G}v^{e_gtd-1}, \; \forall d=2,\ldots |\mathcal D|.

% Hence, if the drone $d_1$ is assigned to the task $t$, every drone $d_2$ that is, for the launching order in $\mathcal D$, before than $d_1$, must perform the task $t$.

The different models that we have proposed include in one way or another big-M constants. We have defined different big-M constants along this work. In order to strengthen the formulations we provide tight upper and lower bounds for those constants. 

\subsubsection*{Big $M$ constants bounding the distance from the launching / rendezvous point on the path followed by the mothership to the rendezvous / launching point on the target $t\in \mathcal{T}$}
%\CV{Quizás las M grandes se pueden estimar, discutir contigo}

To linearize the first addend of the objective function in \AMD, we set the auxiliar non-negative continuous variables $q_L^{to}$ (resp. $q_R^{to}$) to model the product by inserting the following inequalities:
\begin{align*}
q_L^{to} & \geq m_L^{to} u^{to}, \\
q_L^{to} & \leq d_L^{to} - M_L^{to}(1-u^{to}).
\end{align*}
The best upper bound $M_L^{to}$ or $M_R^{to}$ is the full diameter of the data, that is, the maximum distance between every pair of vertices of the targets in $\mathcal{T}$, i.e., every point that must be determined is inside the circle whose diametrically opposite points are explained below. 
$$
M_L^{to} = \max_{\{v, v'\in V\}} \|v - v'\| = M_R^{to}.
$$

Conversely, the minimum distance in this problem can be zero. This bound is attainable whenever the launching or the rendezvous points of the mothership is the same that the rendezvous or launching point on a given  target.

\subsubsection*{Bounds on the big $M$ constants for the distance from the launching to the rendezvous points on the operation $o\in \mathcal{O}$.} When the drone travels in the operation $o$, it has to go from one target $t$ to another target $t'$ depending on the order given by $y^{tt'o}$. This fact produces another product of variables linearized by the following constraints:
\begin{align*}
q^{tt'o} & \geq m^{tt'} y^{tt'o}, \\
q^{tt'o} & \leq d^{tt'}_{\text{out}} - M^{tt'}(1-y^{tt'o}).
\end{align*}

\noindent
The evaluation of the bounds appearing in these constraints presents three cases depending on the structure of the targets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If both targets $t, t'$ are points, then the distance is fixed and we can set
    $$M^{tt'} = \|R^t - R^{t'}\| = m^{tt'}.$$
    \item If one target $t$ is a point and the other $t'$ is a polygonal chain, we can compute the minimum distance as a minimum distance point-to-set problem:
    \begin{align*}
        m^{tt'} = \text{min} &\quad\|R^{t}- x\| \\
                  \text{s.a.} &\quad x\text{ verifies }\eqref{P-C}.
    \end{align*}
    On the other hand, the maximum distance between these targets can be obtained by taking the maximum of the distance between the point $t$ and the breakpoints of the polygonal chain $t'$:
    $$M^{tt'} = \max_{v\in V_{t'}}{\|v - R^t\|}.$$
    \item If both targets $t, t'$ are polygonal chains, it is also possible compute exactly the minimum distance:
    \begin{align*}
        m^{tt'} = \text{min} &\quad\|x'- x\| \\
                  \text{s.a.} &\quad x, x'\text{ verifies }\eqref{P-C}. 
    \end{align*}
    On the other hand, to estimate the maximum distance we can repeat the procedure described in the previous case, but now for each breakpoint of the first polygonal chain. Then, taking the maximum of the maximum distances for each breakpoint we get an upper bound for $M^{tt`}$:
    $$M^{tt'} = \max_{v\in V_{t}, v'\in V_{t'}}{\|v - v'\|}.$$

\section{A Matheuristic for the \AMD}\label{Math}
\noindent
This section is devoted to present our matheuristic approach to provide good feasible solutions of the \AMD. Our motivation comes from the fact that the exact method based on the mathematical programming formulation presented in the previous section can be highly time demanding. Alternatively, the matheuristic provides good quality solution in limited computing times.\\
\noindent

Assuming that the drone has enough endurance to visit every target, the basic idea of the algorithm is to associate each target to one operation by solving a crossing postman problem with neighbors  (XPPN) (see \cite{Puerto2021}) for the targets including $orig$ and $dest$. The motivation of this approach comes from the results in \cite{Puerto2021} which show that the XPPN is easily solvable for medium-size instances provided that the neighbors are points or polygonal chains. 
In the following, we present the pseudo-code of this algorithm:



\begin{itemize} 
\item[STEP 1] (Order of visit the targets)\\
Compute the order of visit by solving the XPPN for the targets of the problem including $orig$ as the first point in the tour and $dest$ as the last one and associate each target $t\in\mathcal T$ to one operation $o\in\mathcal O$ in the given order.
\item [STEP 2] (Solution of the \AMD\space model by fixing an initial partial solution)\\
Set the values of the binary variables $u^{to}$, $v^{to}$, $\delta^{to}$ and $y^{tt'o}$ provided by the solution of STEP 1 and solve the resulting \AMD\space model to obtain a complete feasible solution.
\end{itemize}

%}

It is possible to refine the previous algorithm, by slightly modifying STEP 2. Indeed, after STEP 1, starting from the first visited target, according with the order provided by the XPPN solution, we can iteratively add the next target to the same operation, if the drone endurance allows it. In this way the number of operations can be reduced and a better initial partial solution can be provided to start STEP 2.


Figure \ref{fig:Fig7} shows the solution obtained, by means of the matheuristic, for the same example of Figure \ref{fig:Fig1}. In particular, the upper subfigure reports the solution after STEP 2 in its original form. We can observe that the solution consists in the mothership tour represented in blue and in four operations of the drone. Indeed, the drone first visits the 50\% of the target with label 4 ($u^{41}=v^{41}=1$), then flies to meet the mothership at the retrieve point $x_R^1$ and from there starts its second operation to visit a 50\% of the target with label 3 ($u^{32}=v^{32}=1$). After that, the drone flies to the retrieve point $x_R^2$, it visits another 50\% of the target with label 2 and then, from the launch point $x_L^4$ it starts its last operation to visit also another 50\% of the the target with label 1 ($u^{14}=v^{14}=1$). Then, it flies to the last retrieve point $x_R^4$ and moves to the destination point together with the mothership.
In the lower subfigure of Figure \ref{fig:Fig7} we can observe the solution obtained with the modified version of STEP 2. Differently from the upper one, the number of drone operations is equal to two. Indeed, thanks to the refinement of STEP 2, the drone endurance permits to visit the two targets with label 4 and 3 in the first operation  ($u^{41}=v^{31}=1$ and $y^{431}=1$). Similarly, the drone can also visit two targets, namely 2 and 1, in its second operation ($u^{22}=v^{12}=1$ and $y^{212}=1$).\\ 
In terms of objective function values, in this example, the refinement of STEP 2 does not provide an improved solution. Indeed, its value is equal to 888.01 without refinement and equal to 920.4 with the refinement of STEP 2. 
However, the length of the mothership tour, when STEP 2 is implemented in its original form, is equal to 189.72, while with the refinement of STEP 2 it is equal to 180.39. 
Moreover, we point out that the total time associated with the mothership tour is shorter in the solution without refinement of STEP 2. This is due to the different number of stops performed by the mothership in the two solutions. Indeed, in the solution obtained by the refinement, the number of mothership stops is 4 instead of 5 and, in some of them, the mothership waits for the drone. Summing up, in this example the refinement of STEP 2 generates a solution with a shorter tour of the mothership but with a weighted sum of the distances travelled by both, drone and mothership, that is worse than the one obtained without refinement. In general, depending on the instance and the weighting factor of the two terms in the objective function, the refinement of STEP 2 can provide better solutions. For this reason in the implementation we compared the solutions obtained with and without this refinement, and we select the best one to be provided as initial solution for the exact model.

In this section we discuss the experimental results obtained testing the formulation presented in Section \ref{Form} and the matheuristic procedure proposed in Section \ref{Math} on a testbed of instances.\\
In particular, we consider instances of two typologies: the first one in which the targets to be visited are represented by points randomly located in a square of side 100 units, and the second one where the targets are represented by polygonals.\\
In this latter case, we set the cardinality of the set of points of the polygonal we want to build equal to 4 (this is for guaranteeing that the drone endurance is sufficient for traversing the whole polygonal) and we generate a random value $r$ in the interval $(5, 10)$. This value is used to generate a point $P=(P_x, P_y)$ inside the sub-square $[r, 100-r]^2$.\\
Next, sequentially, we generate a random angle $\alpha \in (0,2\pi)$ and from the current point $P$, we generate a new point $Q=(P_x+r*cos(\alpha), P_y + r*sin(\alpha))$. If point $Q$ belongs to the square $[r, 100-r]^2$, then we connect point $Q$ to point $P$ with a segment. Otherwise, we update $\alpha$ by adding $\pi/6$ to it until we obtain a point $Q^{'}=(P_x+r*cos(\alpha), P_y + r*sin(\alpha))$ that belongs to the square $[r, 100-r]^2$.
Then, the same procedure is repeated to generate the remaining break points of the polygonal.\\
For each of the two typologies, we generate instances of increasing size (number of targets) ranging between 5 and 15. For each size, we consider values of the drone endurance in the set $\{30,40,50,60,70\}$. For each combination of size and endurance value, we generate 5 instances.
We run the formulation on these instances by adopting two different commercial solvers, Cplex and Gurobi, setting a time limit of 2 hours.
Table \ref{table:tab1} shows the results of this comparison. Specifically, for each typology (Type 1 for points, Type 2 for polygonals), for each size and each endurance value, we report the number of instances for which the solvers are able to find at least a feasible solution of the problem within the time limit (\# f.i.), the average gap (Gap) and the average solution time in seconds (Time).

From Table \ref{table:tab1} we can observe that there is a significant difference in the solvers performances. Indeed, Gurobi is not able to find a feasible solution, within the time limit,  for any of  the instances of Type 1 for the largest size instances ($|\mathcal{T}|\in \{14,15\}$)  and for instances of Type 2 from size 8 and drone endurance equal to 40. Moreover, for instances of Type 1 and sizes 12 and 13 and for instances of Type 2 and sizes 6, 7 and 8, it is able to find a feasible solution only for a subset of them, as reported by the counter $\#$ f.i.\\
On the contrary, Cplex is always able to find  feasible solutions for all instances of both Types and for all sizes.\\
\indent This behaviour of the two solvers seems to be explainable by the different internal implementation for handling the lazy constraints in the formulations during the solution process. Indeed, by analyzing the .mps files generated by both solvers, we found out that Gurobi embeds the lazy constraints directly before to start  the branch and bound procedure, while Cplex adds them during the solution procedure when they are actually needed. This difference leads Gurobi to load and solve a more complex formulation since the beginning of the solution procedure. For this reason it is not able to find a feasible solution in 2 hours for most of the largest instances.\\
\indent Regarding the number of instances solved to optimality, Cplex can solve instances up to size 8 of Type 1 within the time limit. In particular, it is able to solve, in average, in less than 6 seconds instances of size 5, in at most 36 seconds instances of size 6, in less than 6 minutes instances of size 7 and in at most 53 minutes instances of size 8. We can observe that the average solution time, increases by an order of magnitude, with respect to the instance size,  up to size 8 and for larger size instances it reaches the time limit of 2 hours. Also considering the comparison between Cplex and Gurobi, we can observe a difference of an order of magnitude in the solution times for Type 1 instances up to size 7 and for Type 2 instances up to size 6.\\

The average gap associated with the solutions provided by both Cplex and Gurobi, ranges between 0.05 and 0.93 and it increases with the instances size. The instances of Type 2 seem to be the most difficult to solve. Indeed, depending on the instances size, the solution time is one or two orders of magnitude greater than that for instances of Type 1. However, from instances of size 12, we can observe that the average gap associated with instances of Type 1, solved by means of Cplex, is always greater than the one associated with instances of Type 2.

Table \ref{table:tab2} summarizes the comparison between the exact solution of the formulation via Cplex, with and without initialization with the solution found by the matheuristic algorithm. For each typology of instances and for each size and drone endurance, we report the average gap with initialization (Gap (i)), the average running time of the matheuristic (Time\_h), the average running time of the formulation (Time\_f) and the average gap without initialization (Gap (wi)). We can observe that the matheuristic  provides a solution of the problem in less than 1 second for instances of Type 1 up to 9 targets and in less than 10 seconds for instances of Type 1 up to 15 targets. The polygonals instances (Type 2) are more challenging to be solved with solution times of the matheuristic ranging between 1.42 seconds and 2.4 minutes. However, comparing these times with those required by exact solution of the formulation, we can conclude that the matheuristic algorithm is a very good alternative to the exact solver. Moreover, we can observe that when the solution provided by the matheuristic algorithm is used to initialize the solver for the formulation, in most of the cases the final average gap slightly decreases after the time limit is reached. The most significant reduction in the average gap can be observed for the largest size instances of Type 2 for which the average gap with initialization is up to 13$\%$ lower than the one without initialization. As regards the computation times for the exact solution method, we can also observe that if the solution provided by the matheuristic algorithm is used to initialize the solver, the convergence to the optimal solution for instances of Type 1 up to 8 targets is significantly improved.

Similarly, Table \ref{table:tab3} reports the comparison between the exact solution of the formulation via Gurobi, with and without initialization with the solution found by the matheuristic algorithm. In this case, the initialization permits to overcome the problem met by the Gurobi solver that, as also reported in Table \ref{table:tab1}, was not able to find a feasible solution for instances of Type 1 from size 14 and for instances of Type 2 from size 8. In particular, we can observe that for instances of Type 1 and from size 9, the initialization with the matheuristic solution improves more than with respect to same process in Cplex in terms of average gap.


In Figure \ref{fig:Fig4} and Figure \ref{fig:Fig5} we show the boxplots representing the gap values for the different instance sizes, distinguishing between the two typologies (Type 1: point or Type 2: polygonal targets) respectively by using Gurobi and Cplex. On the left of both figures we can observe the gap values obtained by solving the formulation without initialization, while on the right, the ones obtained by providing to the solvers the initial solution generated by the matheuristic algorithm. 
Specifically, we can visualize that the gap values for instances with point targets (Type 1) increase with the problem size in the exact solution both without and with initialization and with both solvers. However, as already observed in Table \ref{table:tab1}, Gurobi solver without initialization is not able to solve point instances of size 14 and 15. As regards the polygonal instances (Type 2), we can observe a different behaviour with respect to the gap, which increases with the instances size up to 9 targets. From instances of size 10 its gap, excluding outliers, always ranges in the interval [0.6, 0.8]. This can be still observed also by initializing the exact solution of the formulation even if, as already mentioned, in this latter case the gap values decrease and in most of the cases they belong to the interval [0.6,0.7], always excluding outliers. Thus, the polygonal instances are more difficult than the point instances for sizes up to 10. For bigger size instances, the gap value for polygonal instances consistently belongs to a fixed interval, while the gap for point instances increases with the size.

In order to further investigate this behaviour, we run the mathematical programming formulation with Cplex on one of the biggest size instances with 15 targets and endurance equal to 40, for both types of targets (Type 1 and 2) and setting a time limit of 24 hours. Figure \ref{fig:Fig6} reports the objective function value and the lower bound value obtained over time, respectively, for the point and the polygonal targets versions of this instance. We can observe that the initial value of the lower bound for the point targets instance is equal to 0 while the one for the polygonal targets instance is equal to 331. This difference is due to the different structure of the targets. Indeed, for the polygonal targets the formulation includes the constraint imposing the visit of a given minimum percentage of each polygonal. This implies that the first value of the lower bound is greater than 0. Thus, while the solution process for the point targets instance starts from a gap equal to 100\%, the one for the polygonal targets instance starts from a gap equal to 80\%, as we can also observe in Figure \ref{fig:Fig6}. This different initial gap allows the solver to slowly improve it in the first case but not in the second one. Actually, only after around 15 hours of cpu, we can observe that the two gaps (for the instance of Type 1 and 2) are equal and then the value of the gap for the point targets instance continues to decrease, whereas the one related to the polygonal targets instance does not change in the remaining time. This is explained because the lower bound of the point targets instance improves over time, see Figure \ref{fig:Fig6}, but it does not change at all for the polygonal targets instance.


This behaviour shows that the instances of Type 2 (polygonal targets) are still more difficult to be solved than the instances of Type 1 (point targets). However, the different structure of the targets provides an initial advantage in the lower bound of the polygonal target instances, due to the constraint related to the minimum percentage of each polygonal to be visited, that can be exploited by the solver for the biggest sizes.

\section{Concluding remarks} \label{conclusions}
This papers has analyzed a coordination problem that arises between a mothership vehicle and a drone that is allowed to visit more than one target per operation syncronizing their displacements to minimize travel distances. The mothership can move freely in a continuous space so that the drone can be launched and recovered at any point that is convenient to optimize the problem goal. We present an exact model that  can be adapted to deal with pointwise and graph-like targets. This model is a mixed integer second order cone problem and it can be solved by most of current nowadays solvers. Our computational results show that the considered problem is rather hard and only small to medium size problems can be  solved to optimality. For that reason, we also developed a matheuristic algorithm as a fast alternative to exact methods which provides acceptable feasible solutions in short computing time.

An interesting problem related with the one in this paper is the  the coordination of the operations of one or several motherships with several drones each one of them  allowed to visit more than one target per operation. This is a realistic, challenging  problem that models actual situations in drone's delivery situations but although it is very interesting and deserves to be studied, it  is beyond the scope of this paper and will be the topic of a follow up paper.

\appsection{Appendix: The special case of polygonal chains with equal-length segments}\label{appendix}

This appendix shows a simplification of the constraints modelling traversing a given percentage of the polygonal targets provided that all their segments are of the same length. In that case, we can model the entry point $R^p$ and the exit point $L^p$ associated with the polygonal chain $p\in\mathcal P$ by means of a parameter $\rho^p\in[1, |V_p|]$ (resp. $\lambda^p\in[1, |V_p|]$) that determines the absolute position in $p$. 

To compute the value of these parameters, we can link them with the variables that model the location of the points inside the polygonal by including the following inequalities for each $s_p\in S_p$:
\begin{align*}
    \rho^p - s_p &\geq \gamma_R^{s_p} - |V_p|(1-\mu_R^{s_p}),\\
    \rho^p - s_p &\leq \gamma_R^{s_p} + |V_p|(1-\mu_R^{s_p}),\\
    \lambda^p - s_p &\geq \gamma_L^{s_p} - |V_p|(1-\mu_L^{s_p}),\\
    \lambda^p - s_p &\leq \gamma_L^{s_p} + |V_p|(1-\mu_L^{s_p}).
\end{align*}

The first and second inequalities determine the upper and lower limits for the parameterization of each segment of $p$. If $\mu_R^{s_p}=0$ the inequalities are always fulfilled and there is no entry point in the $s_p$-th segment of the polygonal. Conversely, if $\mu_R^{s_p}=1$ then $\rho^p=\gamma_R^{s_p}+s_p$ meaning that the corresponding entry or exit point is in the $s_p$-th segment of the polygonal and its value is equals to the number of segments plus the part of the segment $s_p$ that has been already traversed. The same idea is applied in the third and fourth inequalities for the $\lambda^p$ parameter.

Finally, we can model the condition of traversing a percentage $\alpha^p$ of the polygonal $p$ by the standard trick for the absolute value constraint:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha-p}\tag{$\alpha-\mathcal P$}
 |\rho^{p}-\lambda^{p}|\geq \alpha^{p} |S_p| \Longleftrightarrow
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{ccl}
  \rho^{p} - \lambda^{p} & = & \nu_\text{max}^{p} - \nu_\text{min}^{p} \\
  \nu_\text{max}^{p} & \leq & 1-{\text{entry}^{p}}, \\
  \nu_\text{min}^{p} & \leq & {  \text{entry}^{p}}, \\
  \nu_\text{max}^{p} + \nu_\text{min}^{p} & \geq & \alpha^{p} |S_p|. \\
 \end{array}
 \right.
\end{equation}

Here $\nu_\text{max}^p$ and $\nu_\text{min}^p$ are auxiliary variables used for linearizing the absolute value and the binary variable $\text{entry}^p$ represents the traveling direction in the polygonal chain $p$.
